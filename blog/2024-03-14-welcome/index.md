We are thrilled that the prototype of Equator, **an open-source community** for fully on-chain game developers, has been created. This is incredible! ü•≥

We will continue to enhance a variety of resources in this community, providing a good learning environment for those who have a passion for fully on-chain games and autonomous worlds.

We plan to do a blog summary irregularly ‚è±Ô∏è, recording the changes in the community over the past.

‚ù§Ô∏è Looking forward to the arrival of a new era!
