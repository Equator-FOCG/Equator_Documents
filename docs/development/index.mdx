# 🛠️ Development

Game engines play a crucial role in game development.

The game engine is a type of middleware. The game engine is a suite of tools designed to enhance game development efficiency.

For fully on-chain games 🎮, there is also a need for a tool that can help developers quickly deploy game logic and state. This not only shortens the development cycle, but also provides a unified data standard for subsequent iterative development and interoperability in the open ecosystem 🌏.
