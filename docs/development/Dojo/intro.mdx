You can choose one of the following methods!

### Install Dojoup

`dojoup` is dojo development toolchain installer.

```bash
    curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash
```

Then run the following command to complete the installation of the tools.

```bash
    dojoup
```

### Building from source

**Prerequisites**: You will need the Rust compiler and Cargo, the Rust package manager. The easiest way to install both is with `rustup`.

By using a single Cargo command:

```bash
    cargo install --git https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo --force sozo katana torii
```

Or, by manually building from a local copy of the Dojo repository:

```bash
    # clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo.git
    cd dojo
    # install Sozo
    cargo install --path ./bin/sozo --force
    # install Katana
    cargo install --path ./bin/katana --force
    # install Torii
    cargo install --path ./bin/torii --force
```
