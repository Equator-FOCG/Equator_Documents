## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Once you have World CLI installed, you can scaffold your first World Engine game by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
world create
```
**Cardinal** is a World Engine game shard framework for building powerful, highly scalable on-chain games.

Through the World Engineâ€™s shard communication interface (SCI), Cardinal interoperates seamlessly with EVM smart contracts on the World Engine stack, providing web2 scale performance for onchain games while preserving interoperability.
