# Autonomous Worlds 🗺️

The ultimate goal of Full On-chain Game, the 'autonomous world', is another explanation of the ultimate form of the digital world (the last explanation was the 'metaverse' that was over-marketed and became commonplace). The autonomous world, as a shared vision of a beautiful future for humanity, has a strong appeal, and Full On-chain Game, as an important means to achieve this goal, is also highly expected.

全链游戏的终极目标“自主世界”，是对数字世界终极形态又一次阐述（上一次阐述是被过度营销化后烂大街的“元宇宙”）。自主世界作为人类对美好未来的共同想象，具有很好的号召力，而全链游戏作为实现该目标的重要途径，也被寄予厚望。

## What is the World?

A World is a container for entities and a coherent-enough internal ruleset about how they behave. When a system of entities and rules comes to life, it becomes a World.

一个世界（world）是一个包含实体与足够一致的内部规则的容器。当一个包含了实体与规则的系统运转起来时，他就成为了一个世界。


当谈论世界时，我们需要用到 diegesis（叙事一致性）这个词。如果我们说某物是 diegetic（符合叙事一致性的），那么他就属于这个“世界”。而如果某个物品想要加入一个“世界”，他就需要遵守这个“世界”的引入规则。
