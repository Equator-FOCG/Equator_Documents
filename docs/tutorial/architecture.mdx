# Game Architecture â›”

## ECS

[ECS (Entity Component Systems)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) improves the flexibility and maintainability of game development by separating logic, data, and entities. This architectural pattern helps reduce code complexity and decoupling, thereby enhancing performance and development efficiency.

1. `Entity`: An entity is a basic object in the game world, such as a character, prop, or scene object. The entity does not contain any data or logic itself, but is a unique identifier that is used to associate components and systems.

2. `Component`: Components are used to store the properties and data of an entity. Each component is responsible for representing a specific feature or function, such as location, speed, or health. Components contain only data and no logic. By combining different components, entities with various functions and characteristics can be easily created.

3. `System`: The system is responsible for handling game logic and behavior. Systems perform operations based on the components that the entity owns. For example, a system that handles movement will look for entities with location and speed components and update their locations based on their speed. The system is independent of the entity and component, making the game logic more modular and reusable.

The ECS model helps to address some of the problems with traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) in game development, such as overly deep inheritance hierarchies and difficulties with code reuse. ECS makes the construction of game objects more flexible, and complex behaviours can be easily created by combining different components. Additionally, ECS helps optimize performance, especially when dealing with a large number of game objects. Many modern game engines, such as Unity and Godot, have adopted ECS as their core architecture.
