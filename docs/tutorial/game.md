## Game Genres

- RPG (Role-Playing Game): In the game, you will play as one or more characters, interact with the environment, complete tasks, gain experience, and strive to level up your character and acquire new skills.

- FPS (First-Person Shooter): In the game, you will fight with firearms or other weapons from a first-person perspective. The game generally tests the player's reaction speed and target positioning ability.

- RTS (Real-Time Strategy): In these game, players concurrently manage resources, construct bases, and battle, among other responsibilities. The combat and decision-making occur in real time, placing certain demands on the player's multitasking abilities.

- SLG (Simulation Game): Literally translated as simulation games, but in the Japanese game industry, SLG is more commonly used to refer to strategy games, including strategic simulation games. These games combine strategy and tactics, allowing players to act as commanders and make overall strategies.

- SIM (Simulate games): Simulation games emphasize the simulation of real-world activities, including armored combat, city construction, business management, life simulation etc. These games can be very specific, and can even simulate a variety of occupations and activities in the real world.

- FTG (Fighting Game): Often used for two-person battles, you operate the character to use various moves to fight at close range, trying to win by reducing the opponent's blood volume to zero.

- STG (Shoot 'em up): The core of these games is usually to control a character or spaceship to eliminate a large number of enemy units. Players usually need to dodge enemy attacks while simultaneously shooting to eliminate them. STG games can be subdivided into many types, such as barrage shooting, side-scrolling shooting, vertical shooting, etc. These types of games usually require high reaction speed and hand-eye coordination from the players.

- TPS (Third Person Shooter): The perspective of these games is set behind the protagonist, allowing players to see not only the protagonist but also the environment within the protagonist's field of view. This design enhances immersion and is conducive to close-quarters combat or strategic combat.

- MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games): The game includes a large number of players online at the same time and role-playing in the same virtual world. The emphasis is on communication, collaboration, and PVP competition with a large number of players.

- MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena): This is mainly team-based warfare, usually two teams of players compete on the same field, each controlling a character, aiming to destroy the other's base.

- Rogue-like/Rogue-lite games: This type originated from a game called "Rogue", characterized by randomly generated levels, high difficulty, and usually needing to restart the game after the player's character dies. Rogue-lite games are slightly changed based on this, generally preserving some progress after the player's character dies.

- Puzzle: Mainly rely on players' thinking to solve puzzles, improve observation and logical thinking abilities.

- AVG (Adventure game): This kind of game is mainly for telling a story, solving puzzles, exploring the world, and talking with NPCs (non-player characters).
