🕹️ **`Game`**: the **Practice** of Jumping Out of Reality.

🎲 **`Game`** are not only a medium for creation and expression and a space for social interaction, but also **the frontier of technology application and innovation**.

⛓️ **`Game`** will help us understand **what blockchain technology will bring to the world**. As a microcosm of the future digital world, they serve as a sandbox for experimentation and innovation. The fictional world carries real significance. That is, to reshape reality through game exploration and demand!

## Provable Game

Thanks to the magic of zero-knowledge proofs, we can ensure a game is fair by verifying a zk proof created off-chain.

But what does that entail? Consider a game of chess. We aim for an experience where players trust each other's moves.

In a straightforward approach — and given the simple rules of chess — if this were in a blockchain environment, every move would be a transaction on the blockchain. This is costly. We just want to know the winner, not every move.

At the end, a zk proof can be submitted to the blockchain to confirm the game's fairness. This constitutes a provable game.
