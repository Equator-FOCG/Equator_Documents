## 👾 Provable Game

Thanks to the magic of zero-knowledge proofs, we can ensure a game is fair by verifying a zk proof created off-chain.

But what does that entail? Consider a game of chess. We aim for an experience where players trust each other's moves.

In a straightforward approach — and given the simple rules of chess — if this were in a blockchain environment, every move would be a transaction on the blockchain. This is costly. We just want to know the winner, not every move.

At the end, a zk proof can be submitted to the blockchain to confirm the game's fairness. This constitutes a provable game.
