## üîë What is Fully On-chain Games?

On-chain Games, also known as Fully On-chain Games or Pureplay On-chain Games.

A game can only be referred to as a "Fully On-chain Game" when **all of its game logic and data are stored on the blockchain**.

:::note

Why bother to build fully on-chain games, put all the state and logic on the chain, and deal with all the complexity that comes with it. The reason is simple üòä, just to get the features that traditional game infrastructure does not have.

## üè∞ The features of FOCG

### 1. Permissionless mods

`A new paradigm of gaming`: This means that all the players and developers can customize any component in the game from a high-level client, including introducing plugins or mods. Even the underlying logic of the game can be extended through smart contracts to expand the gameplay. Essentially, this is a new model wherein each game by default is a new platform, and no matter how small your team is, you can become a content powerhouse.

`Participation and community governance`: Fully on-chain game encourages players to actively participate in the operational decisions and community governance of the game. Players can participate in the development direction and decision-making process of the game through holding tokens, voting, etc., increasing the players' participation and sense of belonging.

`The game's development follows the principle of open ecology`: both the game contracts and the accessible game clients are open source. Third-party developers can completely redeploy, customize, and even fork their own game experiences through plugins, third-party clients, and interoperable smart contracts. This, in turn, enables game developers to leverage the creative output of the entire (incentive-aligned) community.

### 2. Persistency

`Authenticity`: Logic and rules are implemented through smart contracts. For example, fights in the game, not just ownership, are carried out on-chain. Since both the game logic and data are stored on the blockchain, the game rules and states are transparent to everyone. This allows players to verify the fairness of the game and the correctness of the results, increasing the credibility of the game.

`Once on the chain, it runs forever`: Even if the original developers of the game no longer support it, as long as the chain does not stop producing blocks, the game can still continue to run and develop. Since there are no servers that can be censored or shut down, these experiences actually introduce a whole new meaning. However, with this, eternal games could possibly become unsolvable, characterized by continuous and non-trivial gameplay, or an "infinite puzzle". If all else fails, the game breaks down, or the developers leave, but if there is still demand for the game, the forkability ensures the game's continued existence.

### 3. Open economies

`True asset ownership`: In a fully on-chain game, the ownership of game assets in the virtual world can be realized through blockchain technology. Players can freely buy, sell, and trade game assets, no longer restricted by the game's internal closed economic system.

`Verifiable unique digital assets`: In a fully on-chain game, game assets are represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs), each of which is unique and specific. This allows players to verify the authenticity and scarcity of assets based on the data on the blockchain.

`Decentralized trading market`: Fully on-chain games provide an open, fair, and efficient trading environment for players through smart contracts and decentralized trading platforms. Players can directly trade with other players, eliminating the intermediaries and dependence on third-party platforms found in traditional games.
