The birth of Dark Forest was driven by a simple question: could we create a game where every action is an on-chain transaction? In 2020, this was a radical proposition. Many questioned the feasibility of a fully on-chain game because of the slow speed of blockchain technology. Despite these doubts, our curiosity led us to develop Dark Forest.

Dark Forest 的诞生是由一个简单的问题驱动的：我们能否创建一个每个动作都是链上交易的游戏？在 2020 年，这是一个激进的主张。许多人质疑一个完全链上游戏的可行性，因为区块链技术的速度慢。尽管有这种怀疑，我们的好奇心驱使我们开发了 Dark Forest。
